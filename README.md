This is my first webpage so i will try to be clear:)
Builder will take your itemized menu and base on filters and your desires will build a  fancy-look document
with prices per person, self-cost calculation, filters for allergies and other usefull filters in industry.



# Deployment

Server-side will use Node.js and PostgreSQL to perform all CRUD operation.
Frontend Nuxt.js with little touch of TailwindCSS.
