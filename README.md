This is my first webpage so i will try to be clear:)
Menu Builder will take your itemized menu from DataBase and based on filters and your desires will build a "fancy-look" document/list
with prices per person for this Menu, made self-cost calculation, filters for allergies and other usefull filters in industry.



# Deployment

Server-side will use Node.js and PostgreSQL to perform all CRUD operation.
Frontend Nuxt.js with little touch of TailwindCSS.
